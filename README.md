# Data Preparation using Tensorflow Extended 
<h3>In this notebook, we will explore how we can preprocess data professionally in a production environment. We will be using Tensorflow Extended, also known as TFx. </h3>

<h5>⦿ TFx has many components. In this notebook, we will only be using the data-handling components such as ExampleGen, StatisticsGen, SchemaGen, and Transform.</h5>
<h5>⦿ The ML metadata and the generated files are stored inside the pipeline folder.</h5>
<h5>⦿ The dataset we are using is the diabetes prediction dataset, which is a structured tabular dataset.</h5>
